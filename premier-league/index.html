                    <li>The first thing to do is sign up and create or join a league</li>
                    <li>Once you’re in a league, you can pick which players you’d like to prioritize for the draft in
                        case you’re not around. This is known as your auto pick list.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Next comes the draft which is when you actually pick your squad. It goes in turns with a time
                        limit per turn.</li>
                    <li>Once the draft is over, you can select your lineup and when the season starts, you’ll earn
                        points for each of your players based on their weekly performances. You can change your starting
                        lineup and make trades throughout the year.</li>

                Leagues

            <p>
                We offer both classic and head to head leagues, as well as private and public leagues.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Classic Leagues:</b> In classic leagues, teams are ranked based on the total number of points
                    scored by their players throughout the season.</li>
                <li><b>Head To Head Leagues:</b> In head to head leagues, each team plays against another opponent each
                    week of the season. Just like the Premier League, a win is worth 3 points, a draw is worth 1 point,
                    and a loss is worth 0 points.</li>
                <li><b>Private Leagues:</b> Private leagues work the same way as public leagues except they require a
                    password to join them. Private leagues also allow the league creator to manually start the draft
                    with the click of a button.</li>
                <li><b>Public leagues:</b> start automatically at a given date.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <aside>
            <h2>Settings</h2>
            <p>Also, settings for private leagues can be changed before the draft starts, whereas the settings in public leagues can't be changed.</p>

                Picking a well balanced team.

            <dl>
                <dt>Teams</dt>
                <dd>Selecting your FPL team from a range of teams ensures you are well covered in the event that
                    one side does particularly well or badly in any given weekend.</dd>
                <dt>Price</dt> 
                <dd>Ensure that the selection of 1-3 high price players is not at the expense of the rest of your
                    team. It is important that not only 1-3 players are relied upon to score all of your points. If
                    there is an injury, or if the players form drops, it can hurt your points in a big way.</dd>
